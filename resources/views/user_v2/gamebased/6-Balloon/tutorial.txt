+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The logic of this game is as follows:
•	When the page loads, the game initializes with one balloon.
•	The player can inflate the balloon by pressing the space bar. Each inflation increases the value of the balloon by $0.05.
•	The player can bank the current value of the balloon by pressing the enter key. This adds the balloon's value to the banked money and starts a new balloon.
•	However, each balloon has a random limit to how much it can be inflated. If the player inflates the balloon past this limit, the balloon bursts, and the player loses the current value of the balloon. The game then starts a new balloon.
•	This process continues until the player has inflated 45 balloons, at which point the game ends and the total banked money is displayed.
•	The player cannot inflate or bank a balloon while a modal message is being displayed. The game waits for the modal to be closed before allowing the player to continue.
