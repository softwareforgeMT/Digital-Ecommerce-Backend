This code implements the following features:
1.	Initializes game settings, including maximum attempts and the timeout duration.
2.	Listens for a keyboard press and determines whether the key pressed was correct or incorrect based on the images displayed.
3.	Generates new game rounds with randomly chosen images and varying number of rows.
4.	Handles timeout and displays results accordingly.
5.	After half of the maximum attempts have been made, it reduces the timeout duration to make the game more challenging.
