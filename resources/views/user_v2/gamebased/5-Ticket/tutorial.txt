/////////////////////////////Summary//////////////////////////////
Here is a summary of how the game works, based on your code:
1.	When the game starts, the generateCard function is called. This function sets up the game by randomly choosing a shape and a number, and presenting these to the player. There's a 1 second delay before the card is displayed and the question asked.
2.	The player's response is handled by the handleKeyPress function, which checks whether the player's answer is correct or not. It also checks if the player responded too early or too late.
3.	If the player responded too early (before the card was shown and the question asked), there's a 2-second pause before the game accepts more responses.
4.	If the player responded too late (didn't respond within 2 seconds after the question was asked), the game proceeds to the next round without waiting for a response.
5.	The player's total attempts are tracked, and the game ends after a specified number of maximum attempts.
The 'Too Early' and 'Too Late' response handling is an interesting mechanic that introduces an element of timing into the game. It looks like a fun game to play!
Remember to thoroughly test your code with various scenarios to ensure that it works as expected in all cases.
